FinTech: Bank Account Security

This allows students to practice conditional logic within their observers.

-- The Business Rule: An account has a DailyWithdrawalLimit. Any transaction exceeding this must be blocked.

-- The State Change: Account.Withdraw(amount)
-- Observer Opportunities:
    -- Fraud Detection Observer: If a withdrawal is $> \$5,000$,   trigger an SMS verification.
    --  Audit Log Observer: Record every successful transaction into a read-only security log.
