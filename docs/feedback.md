# 🔍 PR Review – DDD Observer Implementation

## General Feedback

Great work implementing the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts together with the Observer pattern. The project structure is clear and the domain logic is separated from side effects, which aligns well with the design principles described in the assignment.

The use of domain entities, value objects, and event-based communication helps prevent silent bugs and keeps the architecture clean and maintainable.

## ✅ Strengths

•⁠  ⁠Good separation between *domain logic* and *application behavior*
•⁠  ⁠Proper use of *Domain Events* to trigger observers
•⁠  ⁠The *Observer pattern* is implemented to decouple side effects from the domain
•⁠  ⁠Smart constructors ensure that invalid data cannot enter the domain
•⁠  ⁠The use of *TypeScript types* improves safety and readability

## 🔎 Logic Checks

### Branded Types

The project correctly uses branded types to avoid primitive obsession. Using ⁠ unique symbol ⁠ ensures that domain values such as ⁠ PriceNumber ⁠ cannot accidentally be treated as raw numbers.

Example pattern:

```ts
type PriceNumber = number & { readonly brand: unique symbol }
