## Hello Peushi! :grin: 
    Here are my feedbacks!

## Overall

The code is super clear and generally well structured. The domain logic is easy to follow, and the separation between files makes the project readable

## Fixes
I would recommend additional validation limits within your factories.
Using readonly for your brand types could also be a great improvement to prevent accidental mutations

For example: 

in **src/domain/survivor/factories.ts** 

    createSurvivorName() -> you should add a limit to reject " " (empty space string) or names with odd charcaters like @ or %.

    createHealth() -> assuming that the health should be within a reasonable range. I'd recommend adding a maximum limit. 


in **src/domain/survivor/survivor.ts** 

    It could be helpful to mark each property of the type as readonly. This would help enforce immutability.
